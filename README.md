![alt text](https://github.com/ayushi911/Spell-Checker/blob/master/project.png?raw=true)

<b> This above is the Actual Photo of what the website looks like</b>

### Introduction 
Due to the increasing use of phones and digital devices we need to constatntly write something or other, and it becomes
really inportant that the spellings are correct for a correct interpretation of the text sent by a user.So this project is a method to use the spellings we use 
correctly and increase our language ability.

### Used resources
This project includes variety of technologies including:<br>
For the website:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 4
- Flask
<br>
Coding Part:

- Python 3
- basic python libraries(like NLTK, enchant etc.)

<br>

### Working
This is a simple project which has a well responsive website and it works as follows:
- The user will input some text in the text box provided on the website.
- The text input is then filtered removing all the unnecessary punctuations and spaces and prepares a list of all words in the text.
- Then after this there will a suggestion box displayed for all the wrong spelling that will be encountered in that text portion.
- These suggestions are standardly obtained from a standard dictionary

##### Further work!
- In further work I aim on integrating smart grammar suggestions as well!
